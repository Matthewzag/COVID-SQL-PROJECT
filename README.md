## Project Overview
This portfolio project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 datasets to:
1. Identify trends in infection, recovery, and fatality rates.
2. Understand the impact of the pandemic across different regions and time periods.
3. Provide actionable insights for public health decision-making.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), which provides comprehensive, globally aggregated data on COVID-19.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database**: SQL (queries executed in [specify environment, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.])
- **Visualization**: Compatible tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) for presenting insights.
- **Languages**: SQL

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed inconsistencies and duplicates.
   - Standardized formats for dates and other fields.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Trend analysis over time.
   - Regional comparisons for key metrics.
3. **SQL Queries**:
   - Used SQL to filter, group, and aggregate data for meaningful insights.

## Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
- Regional hotspots and trends in infection rates.
- Correlations between government responses and case outcomes.
- Temporal patterns in case spikes and recoveries.

## File Structure
- `/data`: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `/sql`: SQL scripts for data analysis.
- `/visualizations`: Dashboards and visualizations created from the analysis.
